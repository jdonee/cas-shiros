h2. What is this project ?

This project *cas-shiros* has been created to test the CAS support for Shiro library, i.e. the *shiro-cas* library. Itï¿½s composed of two modules :
- the *cas-shiros-app* module is a demo web application which uses the CAS Shiro support library with protected area requiring CAS authentication : "http://shiro.apache.org/cas.html":http://shiro.apache.org/cas.html
- the *cas-shiros-server* module is a CAS server configured with remember-me feature.
